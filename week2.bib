	abstract = {The COVID-19 lock/slow down affected humanity and livelihood, while it showed some positive effects on the environment with improvement in air quality indicators. Though many studies published after COVID-19 first phase lockdown observed reduction in pollutants over India, no studies yet compared the air quality indicators over the two lock/slow down windows during 2020–2021. This study reports results of rapid assessment of seven air quality indicators such as Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Formaldehyde (HCHO), Methane (CH4), Carbon monoxide (CO), Aerosol (Ultraviolet Aerosol Index, UVAI), and Ozone (O3) for the past three years on monthly time scale using TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) data on GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform over India, with focus on the Gangetic plain, an air pollution hotspot. Significant reduction in NO2, SO2, HCHO and Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) was observed during March–May 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, while the levels of NO2, SO2, HCHO and CO increased significantly in 2021 compared to March–May 2020. This suggests that COVID-19 lock/slow down in 2020 played a significant role in improving air quality indicators, while the relaxation in 2021 has led to detoriation, compared to 2020. The pyrogenic (forest fire and slash and burn agriculture) and agricultural (wet crop) sources were identified to contaminate the expression of slow/lock down effects on air quality indicators such as HCHO, CO and CH4 over India.},
