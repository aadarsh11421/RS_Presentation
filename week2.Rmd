# Introduction of Sentinel-5P 

- Sentinel-5P is a satellite which was launched in **2017** by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the Copernicus Program

- Its main purpose is to monitor the atmospheric composition of pollutants

- The pollutantns measured by the satellite are:
  - NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO, CH₄, and aerosols
  
- It uses the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to measure these pollutants.

- The data was available for users from 2018

# TROPOMI Characterstics

- TROPOMI Features:
  - The sensor is a passive sensor
  - It has a push broom configuration
  - Spatial Sampling - 7x7 km²
  - Swath Width - 2600 km 
  
- The sensor revisits the same location after 16 days. This is also known as the orbit cycle

- Spectral Ranges - UV, visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared

- It detects the absorption and scattering of the sunlight in the atmosphere by different sizes of particles.

# Spatial Resolution of different Pollutants

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

sensor_data <- read.csv(here::here("Presentation/pollutants.csv"))


kable(sensor_data, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:100%;'", align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

# Applications of Sentinel-5P Data

- This data has a wide range of applications, as it measures 6 pollutants.

- The purpose of this mission was to observe the atmospheric pollutants.

- This data can be used to:
  - Map the pollutants of cities and study the hotspots of different pollutants.
  - Observe the ozone depletion in different parts of the world.
  - Check for methane leaks from oil and gas fields.
  
- Many studies were done during the **COVID-19** using this data to observe the decline in pollution levels across different countries.

- This data is also used in disaster management, especially in volcanic eruption and wildfires as they produce a lot sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide 
  
- This data can also be used to study the affects of the greenhouse gases and observe **Global Warming and Climate change**.

# Reflection

- This data is very useful, as now we can observe and study the changes in the atmosphere from 2017.

- As this data is globally available, it is now possible to keep a check of different countries on their emission levels, which is essential as the planet's temperature is on a rise.

- We can use this to set policies and observe and regulate emissions of industrial areas. 
  
- This data can also be used for to keep a check of the air quality, as this data is easily accessible, medical field can use this in their studies as well.
